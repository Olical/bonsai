> This will need fleshing out once I think the initial release is "done" - @Olical 10th November 2017

Right now, due to the early stages of this project, I'd recomend you shoot me an email or tweet ([@OliverCaldwell][twoot]) asking about what you wish to do. Or maybe open an issue so we can discuss it.

Once I have a clear vision set out and some more features I'll be able to refer you to some sort of "this is how I think things should be" guidance document.

Even then, I'd recommend you run what you're thinking past me so we can talk about it before you do anything I have a reason to disagree with. I don't want to waste your time at all, valued contributor. :smile:

## Tooling

As far as the actual development goes, I start up a Clojure REPL within this directory (usually through CIDER jack in), then I run `(cljs-repl)` inside there. That function is defined in `dev/user.clj`, it is loaded automatically.

You should now have a functioning ClojureScript REPL that you can control with your editor. Hopefully.

Testing is performed with `lein test` for the Clojure parts and `lein test-cljs` for the ClojureScript parts. `test-cljs` maps to `lein doo node test once`. Finally, `lein test-all` will run the tests through Clojure and ClojureScript (obviously stuff like DOM testing is only run in the ClojureScript environment).

I usually have a small terminal open with `lein test-cljs-auto` (`lein doo node test auto`) running. It'll run the tests as I change the files which is very convinient.

Make sure you add some sort of test to prove your change works as expected, they will also  be run for you in [Travis CI][travis].The test results will show up on your pull request.
